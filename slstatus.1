.RB [ \-dhov ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
slstatus is a suckless and lightweight status monitor for window managers that use WM_NAME as statusbar (e.g. DWM) or any other status bars if they support reading/piping from slstatus. It is written in pure C without any extern programs being executed and only reads from files most of the time. slstatus is meant to be a better alternative to Bash scripts (inefficient) and Conky (bloated and written in C++).
